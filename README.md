slide.sh
========

Installation
------------

Put slide.sh in your path or just invoke it via bash:

```
$ bash slide.sh my_slides
```

Everything else
---------------

See the [upstream repo]( https://github.com/ryanuber/slide.sh ) for all
the cool things you can do with formatting and stuff.

In this fork you will no longer be sending slide content as input to a
`slide` command; rather, you just put the content in a file and separate
each slide with the text `slide` on a line by itself.

I've also added `!!vcenter` which starts your content halfway down the
screen.
